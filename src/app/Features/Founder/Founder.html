            <h1>Meet The Founder</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Bashir Alshihabi, founder of “Chehabi Academy” and language teacher. I was born in 1984 in Damascus, Syria and I belong to a poet family which has been concerned with literature and poetry for more than 300 years. I am also a poet and a musician.
                I studied Guitar and Music Theory in Damascus, Stuttgart and Vienna.
